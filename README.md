# SortingAlgorithmsAnimation
A visual representation of the most common sorting algorithms

this is a personal project created in order to have a visual representation of the most common sorting algorithms
Attention: if the elements are surmounted, it is a rendering problem due to the management of JavaScript cycles and activities, because I've used P tag with a background in order to create the vertical line, and the proof is that if you press STOP, you will see the elements rendered in the correct place after a few ms.
